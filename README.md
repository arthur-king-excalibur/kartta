# Kartta Labs

This repository contains the documentation for Kartta Labs: a stack of
open source tools to unrender scanned historical maps. In this open
source project, we develop tools to extract information from historical
scanned maps and present them in vector format.

Our design is based on a set of self-contained modules which can be used
collectively to unrender a historical map. This design let us collaborate
by working on each module quite independently.
See [Kartta Labs Modules](modules.md) to learn more about each module.
We welcome and appreciate your contributions. If you are interested in
implementing/improving one of the modules head to
[contributing](docs/contributing.md) first. We encourage you to file
an issue in this repository to express your interest in a module and
perhaps explain your intended contribution before making a pull request.
